## Some notes

If you lose your wallets, it's not my fault. Script expects to have the wallets in default location and should make a backup before proceeding.

You should make a manual backup just in case if something goes wrong.

If it doesn't work, please DM me on Telegram or in Twitter @CELLgainz
